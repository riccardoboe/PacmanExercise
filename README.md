<h1> Pacman Exercise </h1>
## Description
This code creates the character Pacman from an old videogame that was in many different videogame systems. 
It can create various amounts of Pacmans with a click of a button, and when the "start game" button is pressed the Pacmans will start to wonder the screen.
However, they are limited to the boundaries of the screen.
